# Mars Weather Analysis through Web Scraping

In the <a href="   ">first part </a> of this project focuses on collecting and preparing Martian weather data for analysis. By employing web scraping techniques, the project extracts temperature and atmospheric pressure information from a specialized Mars research <a href="https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html">website</a>. This raw data undergoes meticulous cleaning and transformation processes. Non-numeric values are converted to NaN to ensure the dataset's accuracy and integrity, and rows with missing values in critical fields are removed. The prepared data is then organized into a pandas DataFrame, to do 
 an in-depth analysis.

In the <a href="   ">second part </a>, this project shifts the focus to analyzing the cleaned dataset to uncover insights into Martian climatic patterns. It  converts date and temperature information into appropriate formats for analysis. This project identifies metrics, such as the months with the highest and lowest average temperatures on Mars, and calculates the number of Earth days in a Martian year. These analyses are visualized through graphs, detailing the seasonal temperature fluctuations and atmospheric pressure variations on Mars. The project also explores the unique weather patterns of each Martian month, providing a nuanced understanding of the Martian climate.
